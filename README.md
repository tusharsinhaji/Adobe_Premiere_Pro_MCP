# MCP Bridge for Adobe Premiere Pro

**Operate local Adobe Premiere Pro projects through MCP.**

283 Premiere tools behind `search_tools` / `invoke_tool`, 13 context resources, and 10 guided prompts for Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients. CEP is the supported production bridge; UXP remains experimental.

**Start here:** install the local bridge, open it in Premiere, then run `verify_premiere_connection` before editing. MCP hosts see a small always-on set; call `search_tools` then `invoke_tool` for the rest.

## Install

The supported bridge is the included **CEP panel**. Install the npm package on the same computer as Premiere Pro and your MCP client:

```bash
npm install -g adobe-premiere-pro-mcp
premiere-pro-mcp --install-cep
premiere-pro-mcp --doctor
```

`--install-cep` installs the CEP bridge, enables the required Adobe CEP debug setting, prepares the bridge directory, and configures supported local MCP clients. `--doctor` verifies the server build, CEP installation, bridge directory, debug setting, and client configuration.

Then restart Premiere Pro, open `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`, set the bridge directory shown by the installer, and start the bridge.

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- Adobe Premiere Pro 2020+
- Premiere Pro, the MCP client, and this package on the same computer

The bundled `uxp-plugin` is an **experimental preview**. It is shipped for evaluation but is not a replacement for the validated CEP bridge and is not installed by the CLI.

### Codex plugin

From a clone of this repository, install the Codex plugin that bundles the MCP configuration and Premiere editing skill:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add .
codex plugin add premiere-pro-mcp@adobe-premiere-pro-mcp
```

The plugin still requires the local CEP bridge. Run `premiere-pro-mcp --install-cep`, restart Premiere, start `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`, then ask Codex to run `get_capabilities` followed by `verify_premiere_connection`.

### Claude Code plugin

From a clone of this repository:

```text
/plugin marketplace add .
/plugin install premiere-pro-mcp@adobe-premiere-pro-mcp
```

Install and start the CEP bridge with the same steps as above before using the plugin.

### Claude Desktop one-click bundle

Each GitHub release includes an `.mcpb` bundle for Claude Desktop. Download the matching `adobe-premiere-pro-mcp-<version>.mcpb` asset and open it in Claude Desktop to install the local MCP server. Its first launch installs the bundled CEP bridge for the current user.

Restart Premiere Pro, open `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`, set the bridge directory, and start the bridge. Then ask Claude:

> Run `verify_premiere_connection`. Make no changes.

The MCPB bundle is unsigned. Install it only from this repository's GitHub Releases. CEP release archives are labeled accurately as unsigned or self-signed; self-signed does not mean Adobe Marketplace trusted.

### MCP client configuration

The installer configures Claude Desktop on macOS and Claude Desktop plus GitHub Copilot in VS Code on Windows. For another MCP client, configure it to run:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "premiere-pro": {
      "command": "premiere-pro-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

To opt out of anonymous usage telemetry, add `"env": { "PREMIERE_MCP_TELEMETRY": "0" }` to that server entry. See [Telemetry](#telemetry).

### Install from source

Use source setup when developing the MCP, modifying the CEP panel, or troubleshooting a package install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP.git
cd Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP
npm install
npm run build
npm run setup:mac # macOS
```

On Windows, use `npm run setup:win` from PowerShell after `npm install` and `npm run build`.

## Current Status

This repository is currently validated for:

- macOS
- Windows installer/config smoke checks through GitHub Actions
- Adobe Premiere Pro 2020+ (actively used and tested on Premiere Pro 26.0)
- Node.js 20+
- MCP v2 server transport with modern stateless protocol discovery
- the included macOS installer path for Claude Desktop
- the included Windows installer path for GitHub Copilot in VS Code and Claude Desktop config
- manual MCP registration for Codex, Claude Code, and similar MCP clients

Current catalog status as of August 31, 2026:

- `283` catalog tools (`search_tools`, `get_tool_schema`, `invoke_tool`, plus 280 Premiere operations)
- `tools/list` advertises the small always-on set by default (`search_tools`, `get_tool_schema`, `invoke_tool`, `verify_premiere_connection`, `list_sequences`). Set `PREMIERE_MCP_TOOLSET=full` to list every tool, which is what Claude Code native tool search indexes
- coverage spans project setup, media ingest, bins, sequences, timeline editing, transitions, effects, keyframes, captions, markers, metadata, proxies, multicam, color, audio, exports, and higher-level assembly workflows
- the catalog includes practical agent workflows such as product-spot assembly, motion-graphics demos, timeline razoring, caption reads, audio ducking, scene edit detection, EDL import, export readiness validation, and linked audio/video operations

Most recent completed local live validation:

- `283` catalog tools; `get_capabilities` reports `catalog.advertised` vs `catalog.tools`, local installation, and optional live connection state. `verify_premiere_connection` is the canonical read-only bridge and host readiness check
- `0` known parked or placeholder tools are advertised
- `import_ae_comps` is intentionally not advertised because Premiere returned `false` for real `.aep` fixtures in this environment and a generic `.aep` import can wedge the CEP bridge

The full live sweep output is written to `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge/live-tool-sweep.json` when you run the verifier.

## What You Get

The server covers project operations, ingest, sequence creation, timeline editing, transitions, effects, keyframes, metadata, exports, and higher-level assembly workflows.

Example prompts:

- "List all sequences and show me which one is active."
- "Import these three shots and build a rough product spot."
- "Add cross dissolves to every cut on video track 1."
- "Apply Gaussian Blur to the middle clip."
- "Apply the `Black & White` effect to the active short-form clip."
- "Razor the interview sequence at 12.5 seconds across all audio and video tracks."
- "Export the active sequence as FCP XML."

For monochrome looks, prefer `apply_effect` with `Black & White` instead of trying to force black and white through generic saturation-only adjustments.

Before editing, you can also attach the `premiere://config/get_instructions` resource to give the model Premiere-specific operating guidance.

For a predictable start to every session, first run `verify_premiere_connection`. It confirms that the CEP bridge responded and returns the Premiere build, open project, and active sequence without modifying the project.

High-level workflow tools included:

- `build_motion_graphics_demo`
- `assemble_product_spot`
- `build_brand_spot_from_mogrt_and_assets`

`assemble_product_spot` and `build_brand_spot_from_mogrt_and_assets` now support an optional `clipPlan` argument so an LLM can direct per-clip timing, track placement, transitions, motion, trims, effects, and color adjustments instead of relying on fixed template defaults.

## Agent Skill

If you want Codex, Claude Code, or another agent to handle installation, verification, and day-to-day usage correctly, install the included Agent Skill:

```bash
npx skills add hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP --skill premiere-pro-mcp
```

Or install directly from the skill path:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP/tree/main/skills/premiere-pro-mcp
```

The skill teaches agents how to install the MCP, start and verify the CEP bridge, use the Premiere tools safely, import real media before editing, prefer sequence-aware operations, and run diagnostics when something fails.

## Advanced Setup and Verification

For source installs, client-specific MCP configuration, Windows installer flags, diagnostics, and the live tool sweep, use [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md). It is the canonical setup guide and keeps this page focused on choosing and using the product.

The short version:

1. Install with `npm install -g adobe-premiere-pro-mcp`, then run `premiere-pro-mcp --install-cep`.
2. Restart Premiere Pro and your MCP client, then start `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`.
3. Run `premiere-pro-mcp --doctor`, then ask the client to call `verify_premiere_connection` without making changes.

For manual registration in any MCP client, use the global command after npm installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "premiere-pro": {
      "command": "premiere-pro-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The supported UI bridge is CEP. If Premiere does not expose the extension, enable **UXP Plugins > Enable developer mode** in Premiere preferences, restart Premiere, and reopen the CEP panel. The bundled UXP panel remains experimental.

For a real-host sweep, use a disposable Premiere project and run `node scripts/live-tool-sweep.mjs`; it creates temporary `Sweep ...` sequences in the current project.

## How the Bridge Works

```text
+-----------+        +-----------+        +-----------+
|  Client   |  MCP   | Node.js   | Files  | CEP Panel |
| (Codex+)  |<------>| MCP Server|<------>| (Premiere)|
+-----------+        +-----------+        +-----------+
                                                 |
                                                 v
                                          +-----------+
                                          | Premiere  |
                                          | DOM / QE  |
                                          +-----------+
```

1. The client calls an MCP tool.
2. The Node server generates ExtendScript plus shared helpers.
3. The script is written into `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`.
4. The CEP panel polls that directory and runs the script through `CSInterface.evalScript()`.
5. The panel writes the result back to the response file.
6. The server returns structured JSON to the MCP client.

## Tools

All `283` catalog tools have an implementation. `tools/list` advertises a small always-on set so hosts that dump every MCP schema do not spend the context window on unused Premiere operations (Anthropic tool-search / MCP progressive discovery). Call `search_tools` (BM25 `query` or regex `pattern`), optionally `get_tool_schema`, then `invoke_tool`. Set `PREMIERE_MCP_TOOLSET=full` to restore a flat 283-tool list. This catalog explains the editing surface in human terms. Start with `verify_premiere_connection`, then inspect the project before asking an agent to mutate it.

### Additional supported operations

The remaining catalog covers lower-level control of media properties, project settings, display formats, anti-aliasing, poster frames, color labels, selection, track targeting, project paths, and project counts. It includes `set_override_frame_rate`, `set_override_pixel_aspect_ratio`, `set_frame_blend`, `set_time_interpolation`, `set_poster_frame`, `set_anti_alias_quality`, `set_uniform_scale`, `set_scale_width_height`, `set_sequence_display_format`, `set_project_scratch_disk`, `get_project_scratch_disks`, `get_all_project_paths`, `get_total_clip_count`, `get_insertion_bin`, `is_work_area_enabled`, and `match_frame`.

Use MCP introspection in your client for each tool's exact input schema and return shape. An agent should inspect first, make a focused mutation, and read back the affected state before continuing a multi-step edit.

## Real Limits

- A self-signed CEP `.zxp` confirms archive integrity but is not Adobe Marketplace approval or a public trust guarantee. The reproducible signing workflow requires private certificate secrets and target-platform Premiere validation.

This project is much more usable than the original prototype, but it is not magic.

- Premiere scripting still does not expose every UI operation cleanly.
- Professional title design still depends on real MOGRT assets or external graphics workflows.
- `get_render_queue_status` is only useful when Adobe Media Encoder integration is available.
- The best results come from real source footage, real audio, and real brand assets. The automation layer assembles and manipulates them; it does not replace editorial judgment.

## Telemetry

Anonymous usage telemetry is on by default so we can see how many people run the server, which tools they use, and which tools fail.

Each event is an install id, OS, and package version. `server_started` counts installs. Tool calls include the tool name and whether they succeeded. We keep every failure, and at most one successful call per tool per install per day. Failures also include duration, a short error code, the Zod field names that failed, and a path-stripped error template. Project names, media paths, arguments, and results are not sent. Details are in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

Opt out in any of these ways:

- Uncheck **Share anonymous usage data** in `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`
- Set `"telemetry": false` in `~/.premiere-mcp-bridge/config.json`
- Set `PREMIERE_MCP_TELEMETRY=0` in the MCP server environment
- Set `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`

By default `tools/list` advertises `search_tools`, `get_tool_schema`, `invoke_tool`, `verify_premiere_connection`, and `list_sequences`. Call `search_tools` then `invoke_tool` for the rest of the catalog. Set `PREMIERE_MCP_TOOLSET=full` to advertise every tool (use this when the host natively defers MCP schemas, as Claude Code tool search does).

## Updates

When a newer package is on npm, the MCP Bridge panel shows **Update now** and **Later**. Later snoozes the prompt for 7 days. Agents also see this on `get_capabilities`. Opt out with `PREMIERE_MCP_UPDATE_CHECK=0` or `"updateCheck": false` in `~/.premiere-mcp-bridge/config.json`.

## Troubleshooting

If the tools are visible but calls fail:

1. Confirm Premiere Pro is open with a project loaded.
2. Open `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`.
3. Confirm the temp directory is exactly `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`.
4. Click `Start Bridge`.
5. If you updated the bridge code, right-click the panel and choose `Reload`.
6. Retry the command.

If the MCP client cannot find the server:
